Produk Keramik Landing Page

In this project, I built a landing page using React JSX as the main library for building the user interface. For styling, I use Tailwind CSS, which allows me to write styles more efficiently without having to create lots of separate CSS files.

To make development faster and more optimal, I use Vite as a build tool. Vite has advantages in startup speed and Hot Module Replacement (HMR), so code changes are immediately visible without the need to reload the page. Apart from that, Vite also produces builds that are lighter and more efficient compared to traditional tools such as Webpack.
